For this app Giphy API was used along with Javascript and jQuery to  make a webpage that could display a grid of gifs populated by the user's topic of choice.

<h2>How does it work</h2>

When the webpage is displayed, it shows a few initial buttons. Those buttons are stored in an array of topics that are displayed as buttons.

When the user clicks on a button, it will use the Giphy API to search for 12 gifs that are going to be displayed on the page as non-animated at first. It will be displayed with its title and rating, if available, and with a download button that will allow the user to open the gif in another tab to download it.

As stated before, the gifs will be displayed as non-animated. To animate the gif it is necessary to click on the gif.

The user can add topics to its search by just adding a new topic in the Add topic box. This will create a new button in  the buttons section.
